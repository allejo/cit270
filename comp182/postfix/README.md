PostFix
=======

A homework assignment where I had to write a Java implementation of "post fix" expressions

Notice to Students
------------------

This is all code that I have written for my homework assignments and have
decided to release it as open source. I have purposely chosen one of the most
permissive open source licenses in order to help others learn. I ask that you
please do not use my code and call it your own, not because I don't want it
stolen, but because if you managed to find my code, so can your professor or
instructor. It might also imply that you need help with Java so I bid you good
luck pulling off my code as your own.

My code is here to help you learn not to encourage cheating. By using any of my
code, you accept that in no event shall I be held liable for any claim or
liability due to the use or misuse of my code.

Notice to Professors
--------------------

My sincerest apologies for ruining any of your assignments by posting a solution
on the Internet. Look at the bright side, you now have a reference to see if
your students are cheating and you can change assignments so you don't seem
boring and repetitive to classes each semester!

I have not posted the exact assignment so there are no grounds for plagiarism. I
have written all this code from the ground up meaning I have full copyright,
therefore I can do whatever I want with it and I chose to release it as open
source.
